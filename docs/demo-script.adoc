= Code Ready Workspace Demo Script

.Demo Resources
****
This was originally based on the CICD demo in ARO referenced link:http://aroworkshop.io/[here].
****

== Setting the Scene (for slides?)

For the conceit of this demo, Tasks is an application that you would like to have managed by remote teams or temporary staff, thus making RedHat's CodeReady Workspaces an appealing option.

Marc manages a team of temporary (or remote) developers, and Bryon is one of those remote developers.  Tasks is an application that Grocery.com runs on their OpenShift platform (see <<Technical Context>>)

Tasks is an application that is under revision control, but access to this code must be limited in a private repository.  Moreover, temporary workers have slightly conflicting priorities

* They must get up to speed quickly and be productive
* They must not be able to access the source code directory or clone it to their laptops

In this demo, you will see

* Marc setup a CodeReady Workspace for Bryon to use
* Marc invite Bryon to the workspace
* Watch Bryon change code in the new workspace whilst Marc watches
* See a commit to the internal git repository trigger a model continuous integration pipeline
* Test deployed changes in Dev and notice a bug
* Use CodeReady workspaces to find the bug
* Post Mortem: Look at the results of the static analysis in the CI/CD that might have found the bug
* Promote to staging

== Technical Context

First we want to give some context to the toy application and environment that we've set up.

All of this is to support an JBoss EAP app called link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-tasks["Tasks"] that highlights aspects of OpenShift's functionality.  


NOTE: The demo was built using Azure Red Hat OpenShift 3.11.  This is a managed offering of OpenShift that can be purchased from Microsoft.  There is nothing particularly special about this cluster.

=== Projects and Environments

In this demo, we have 3 different projects:

* Tasks - Dev: This is meant to represent our Dev environment for Tasks
* Tasks - Stage: This is meant to represent our 
* CI/CD: This project contains our devops including
** A sample OpenShift Pipeline, a pre-defined CI/CD pipeline on ARO.
** Jenkins, open source CI/CD engine and automation server.
** Nexus, software artifact repository.
** SonarQube, a static analysis platform
** Gogs, a self-hosted GitHub service (with attendant database)

Navigate to the Tasks application and play around briefly.

== Installing CodeReady Workspace

1. Download the CodeReady Workspace installer from link:access.redhat.com[]
2. _Optional:_ Change storage to be per-workspace
3. Run the deploy script to install CRW in demo-workspaces
----
./deploy.sh â€”deploy -p=demo-workspaces \
    --operator-image=registry.redhat.io/codeready-workspaces/server-operator:1.0 \
    --server-image=registry.redhat.io/codeready-workspaces/server-rhel8:1.2
----
NOTE: This installs an *Operator* which in turn installs all the required components for CRW.  It will take a few minutes to setup.  At this point, you could switch to a CRW you prepared earlier

4. Open the overview for the demo-workspaces project.  Click on the exposed route for the CRW
5. You will be prompted to log in.  Enter Marc's login details
NOTE: This is part of the keycloak implementation that allows accounts to restrict access to the CRW
6. Bryon will also register with email address brbaker@redhat.com in a separate browser

== Setup a workspace for Tasks

1. Create a new JBoss workspace
2. In a separate tab, open the route to the gogs workspace
* Point out the service route of the gogs workspace
* replace the clone http route with the service name of the route
----
http://gogs.cicd.svc.cluster.local:3000/gogs/openshift-tasks.git
----
3. Open the new workspace
4. Click on Import Project

image::../images/import-project.png[]

5. Configure as Maven

image::../images/project-configuration.png[]

6. Go to Configure workspace

image::../images/configure-workspace.png[]

7. Go to the workspaces view and share with brbaker@redhat.com

image::../images/share-workspace.png[]

== Edit the code

1. Open *index.jsp*.  Open the file by navigating to it (from assistant menu)

image::../images/navigate-to.png[]

2. Find and Replace "OpenShift Tasks" with "Azure Red Hat Openshift Tasks"
3. Navigate to: *DemoResource.java*
4. _Watch_ Bryon make the following changes to the *toggleHealth* method:

====
image::../images/toggle-health-delta.png[]
====

== Compile the code

1. Build the project by using the maven build command (from UI)

image::../images/build-success.png[]

====
TODO: Fill this in!
====

== Commit the code

1. Open Git window by going to Git > Commit

image::../images/git-commit.png[]

2. Make sure the changes are selected, enter a commit message, and click commit (_note: don't push to origin yet_)

3. Shrink the existing tab and in a new window (Window #2), go to the *CI/CD* project in OpenShift.
* Select the Build > Pipelines option on the right in Window #2
====
image::../images/pipelines-view.png[]
====

4. In Window #1, open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and push to origin

5. Navigate to the Tasks - Dev route.  Play with the app
* Notice the issue where you don't get a message when toggling back to healthy

image::../images/tasks-dev-broken.png[]

== Debugging the container

There is clearly an issue that we're not getting a message whenver we toggle health.  We need to debug this issue.

WARNING: You need to ensure the DeploymentConfig for the Tasks pod has JAVA_OPTS that include the debugger flags

1. Navigate to *DemoResource.java* and set a breakpoint on line 71 by clicking on the number
2. Window #2> In a new tab of this window, look up the IP address of one of the running containers
* Open the "Tasks - Dev" project
* Go to Application > Pods
* Select the running tasks pod and look at the details.  Find the IP address of the pod

image::../images/task-dev-ip.png[]

3. Go to the CodeReady Workspace and select Run > Edit Debug Configuration
4. Using IP address, update the Debug Configuration per this image:

image::../images/remote-debug-configuration.png[]

5. Click Save, then click Debug
* Notice the Debug "perspective" in the workspace window

6. In Window #2, click on Toggle Health
* You should show up in the debugger in Window #1

7. Demonstrate stepping functionality, watch window, and stack trace.
8. Fix the code and recommit and deploy from the command line
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Fix toggleHealth"
$ git push origin
----

== Promote to Staging

1. Make sure Window #2 is set to Build > Pipelines on the commit from last section
2. Wait until "Promote to STAGE?" lights up so you can click it
* NOTE: If you miss it, just click the *Start Pipeline* button in the corner

== Post Mortem

1. Static Analysis Warned us!
